# CProgramTracer
CProgramTracer is a simple program written in Java for keeping tracks of different C blocks (A block is {...}) and the variables initialized / updated inside them. It demonstrates my skills in writing Object Oriented Programs and Stack using Java.

## Original Question
One of the important features of the C programming language is the block
structure of its programs. A block in C is a group of declarations and statements
that are included within a pair of curly braces, each of which contains its own set
of local variables as well as other control statements such as loops, ifs, function
calls, and so on and so forth. A major feature of these blocks is the fact that they
are able to be nested, which basically means that any given block can contain
other blocks inside of them. The purpose of this assignment is to read a C
program from a text file and keep track of the initial values stored within
variables of any given block.
